Different games and animations done in python in order to improve my habilities with this language through coding. 

Some of them are translations from code done in the javascript course from freecodecamp.org by Frank's laboratory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c
Assets provided in the same course, but originally from https://bevouliin.com/
